<!-- 1. Topic sentence(s) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: orient the learner to the area covered in this module

    Heading: do not add an H1 or H2 title here, the auto-generated H1 will appear above this content automatically

    Example: "Azure Logic Apps let you automate your business processes and run them in the cloud."

    Recommended: visual like an image, table, list, etc. that supports the topic sentence(s)

TODO INTRO

<!-- 2. Scenario -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: describe the real-world scenario this module will use to illustrate the concepts

    Heading: use the H2 "Example scenario"

    Example: "Suppose you work at an athletic shoe company on the marketing team. You're launching a new basketball shoe created by a celebrity athlete. Previous launches resulted in a social media frenzy as people shared stories and photos of themselves wearing their new shoes. The marketing team wants to monitor hundreds of social media sites, blogs, and websites to determine consumer reaction. There will be more data than you can process manually. You would like a cloud-hosted system that automates monitoring, text analytics, database storage, and email notifications."

    Recommended: an image that visualizes the scenario

    Optional: a "scenario video" that visualizes the scenario

## First Contact

You are attending your first Hackathon and as you take a quick break from coding your heart out, you notice company booths at a distance. You have heard of internships from senior peers before and have applied to multiple opportunities in the past, but this time you get to talk to a recruiter or engineer directly. You approach the table and discover that contrary to popular opinion, recruiters and engineers are not extraterrestrial beings, but regular people just like you! How do you make a good impression and stand out from other attendees? You want to make sure that your resume peaks their interest, but most importantly, that you convey who you are as an individual in a very short time-frame.


<!-- 3. Prose table-of-contents --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: List the activities the learner will do in this content. This differs from the title and the learning objectives. The title and the learning objectives are "outcome focused"; that is, they describe the skills the learner will acquire as a result of consuming this content. By contrast, here you should be specific about what the learning will **do** in order to acquire those skills. The format can be either prose or bulleted-list; however, a list will yield better results when transformed into other output types such as PowerPoint.

    Heading: use the H2 "What will we be doing?"

    Example: "Here, you'll create a business workflow using Azure Logic Apps to automate the processing of tweets:
                * **Launch**: when a new tweet is available
                * **Process**: determine if the sentiment of the tweet is positive or negative
                * **Route**: branch based on the sentiment score"

 -->
## What will you learn?

This module will cover the basics of networking, how to build a resume, how to phrase your experience and how to properly format it to peak a recruiter's interest.

<!-- 4. Terminal learning objective ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: This is a restatement of the module title into a complete sentence. You have more room here to convey the main goal than in a space-limited title. Make it outcome-focused so it describes the main skill the learner will acquire as a result of this training. In other words, it should answer the question: "what is the key thing the learner will be able to do as a result of consuming this training?"

    Heading: use the H2 "What is the main goal?"

    Example: "By the end of this session, you'll be able to create workflows which route and process data using Azure Logic Apps and its built-in connectors."

 -->
## What is the main goal?

By completing this module, you will be able to build and update your resume in preparation for internship applications and apply networking skills to make you stand out during the recruiting process.

# Resume Writing: You know your goal, but how do you take the first step?

The first step to get noticed will come through your resume. Although it may seem simple, the way you phrase and describe your experiences will decide whether your application is noticed or overlooked. Recruiters can scan hundreds of resumes daily, and only those that catch their attention will be moved forward in the hiring process. Therefore you need to ensure that your resume complies in both format and content to what the recruiters are looking for. This starts by looking at the position/internship you are interested in.

## What to Look For

- **The "Obvious"**:
    - *Minimum Requirements for the position*: If you do not meet the minimum requirements, your application will most likely be overlooked. However, this should not stop you from applying, as this information will serve as guidance towards what skills you should develop. **No internship expects an expert**. As such, if you begin working on the minimum requirements, you will most likely meet them by the time you interview. 
    - *Technical skills that are listed as 'preferred'*: These are skills that may not be necessary, but having them will give you a head-start. List these and determine which ones you already have, and which ones are achievable before interviewing.

- **The Not So Obvious (but just as important)**:
    - *Soft Skills*: These are not as easy to find as Technical Skills, due to them being mentioned in paragraphs such as job descriptions. Soft skills such as communication and team-work can be written like this:
    - >  "you are responsible for driving cross-team collaboration...negotiate design solutions...expected to collaborate with other interns"

### Identifying your strengths and skills

Once you have gathered the job posting's information, the next step is identifying where you stand with respect to it. To do this, follow these steps:
1. Create two lists from the gathered information. One for technicall skills and one for soft-skills.
1. Compare the list of technical skills required with the technical skills you possess.
1. Determine where you acquired these skills, and list these sources. These could have come from classes, bootcamps, online courses, personal projects, hackathons, and more.
1. Determine any overlaps, such as a project where you acquired/implemented one or more of these technical skills and assign them a priority. Resumes are only expected to be one page long for a student, so you will need to choose experiences that show more of your skills.
1. Now, using the list of soft-skills you created, identify which of these were used in the higher priority experiences, and make a note to include them in the descriptions you will write.

## Describing your experience

In order to stand out, you must be able to condense your experience into short yet insightful bullet points. However, the descriptions must go beyond what your duties were. Most people will tend to focus on their duties, rather than showing **their impact**. To further explain this, let's create a scenario with a class project.

Suppose you worked on a Python class project that required bug fixing for a calculator to work correctly. You identified the issues, implemented the fixes and tested before turning it in for grading. How would you describe this project in your resume? 

> Calculator Project - Programming II Class Example University 2020
> - Programmed a calculator program using Python.
> - Fixed bugs that were in the original code

Although this example technically describes what your project entailed, as well as your duties; it sounds like a very basic project and does not help to showcase you as an individual. By rephrasing it following an impact-based template however, the project can seem more interesting and eye-catching.

> Calculator Class Project - Example University 2020
> - *Ensured* the correct functionality of a calculator program by *identifying* **X** bugs utilizing Python Exemption classes and debugging tools, *implementing fixes* and *testing* the program through **Y** test cases.

This statement showcases the impact you had in the project right from the start, as you describe *what* you did (your impact). Next, the statement leads the reader to know *how* you did it, and provided *data (X and Y)* to measure your work. Following a similar template to this, your bullet points will not only catch the attention of recruiters, but also exemplify how you communicate your impact.

An easy to follow template then, can look like this:

> Achieved (*or any impact-driven action verb*) _____ (*what you achieved*) by doing ____ (*how you achieved it*), measured by ____ (*any number that serves as context for your description. Though not always necessary, it helps bring value to your actions*).

## Next Steps

Now that you know how to write and phrase your experiences, the next step is to build your resume.

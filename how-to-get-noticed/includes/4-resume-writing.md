# Resume Writing: You know your goal, but how do you take the first step?

The first step to get noticed will come through your resume. Although it may seem simple, the way you phrase and describe your experiences will decide whether your application is noticed or overlooked. Recruiters can scan hundreds of resumes daily, taking between about 10 seconds in the initial scan and only those that catch their attention will be considered to be read in full. Therefore you need to ensure that your resume complies in both format and content to what the recruiters are looking for. This starts by looking at the position/internship you are interested in.

## What to Look For

- **The "Obvious"**:
    - *Minimum Requirements for the position*: If you do not meet the minimum requirements, your application will most likely be overlooked. However, this should not stop you from applying, as this information will serve as guidance towards what skills you should develop. **No internship expects an expert**. As such, if you begin working on the minimum requirements, you will most likely meet them by the time you interview. 
    - *Technical skills that are listed as 'preferred'*: These are skills that may not be necessary, but having them will give you a head-start. List these and determine which ones you already have, and which ones are achievable before interviewing.

- **The Not So Obvious (but just as important)**:
    - *Soft Skills*: These are not as easy to find as Technical Skills, due to them being mentioned in paragraphs such as job descriptions. Soft skills such as communication and team-work can be written like this:
    - >  "you are responsible for driving cross-team collaboration...negotiate design solutions...expected to collaborate with other interns"

### Identifying your strengths and skills

Once you have gathered the job posting's information, the next step is identifying where you stand with respect to it. To do this, follow these steps:
1. Create two lists from the gathered information. One for technicall skills and one for soft-skills.
1. Compare the list of technical skills required with the technical skills you possess.
1. Determine where you acquired these skills, and list these sources. These could have come from classes, bootcamps, online courses, personal projects, hackathons, and more.
1. Determine any overlaps, such as a project where you acquired/implemented one or more of these technical skills and assign them a priority. Resumes are only expected to be one page long for a student, so you will need to choose experiences that show more of your skills.
1. Now, using the list of soft-skills you created, identify which of these were used in the higher priority experiences, and make a note to include them in the descriptions you will write.

## Describing your experience

In order to stand out, you must be able to condense your experience into short yet insightful bullet points. However, the descriptions must delve deeper than simply writing what you did, as most people will tend to focus on their duties rather than showing **their impact**. Impact showcases your skills better than statements, and can include both technical and non-technical experiences. With this in mind, let's explore how to best address your experiences.

### Technical Experience

Technical experience will include anything you had an impact on, that can be related to technical skills. Personal or class projects, research positions, teaching assistant or tutoring positions, hackathon projects, etc. These are attractive to recruiters as they cover where you acquired or how you implemented these skills, but also provide grounds for a more technical chat in interviews. Therefore, it is incredibly important to have these experiences written in an *efficient*, *eye-catching* way where your *impact* is highlighted.

To illustrate this, let's create a scenario with a class project:

Suppose you worked on a Python class project that required bug fixing for a calculator to work correctly. You identified the issues, implemented the fixes and tested before turning it in for grading. How would you describe this project in your resume? 

> Calculator Project - Programming II Class Example University 2020
> - Programmed a calculator program using Python.
> - Fixed bugs that were in the original code

Although this example technically describes what your project entailed, as well as your duties; it sounds like a very basic project and does not help to showcase you as an individual. By rephrasing it following an impact-based template however, the project can seem more interesting and eye-catching.

> Calculator Class Project - Example University 2020
> - *Ensured* the correct functionality of a calculator program by *identifying* **X** bugs utilizing Python Exemption classes and debugging tools, *implementing fixes* and *testing* the program through **Y** test cases.

This statement showcases the impact you had in the project right from the start, as you describe *what* you did (your impact). Next, the statement leads the reader to know *how* you did it, and provided *data (X and Y)* to measure your work. Following a similar template to this, your bullet points will not only catch the attention of recruiters, but also exemplify how you communicate your impact.

An easy to follow template then, can look like this:

> Achieved (*or any impact-driven action verb*) _____ (*what you achieved*) by doing ____ (*how you achieved it*), measured by ____ (*any number that serves as context for your description. Though not always necessary, it helps bring value to your actions*).

### Non-Technical Experience

A common misconception when applying to technical internships is that non-technical experience has no value in a resume. Most students believe all companies care about is how good or experienced they are in programming languages, software concepts, data structures or even math! However, non-technical experience provides unique ways to showcase who **you** are as well as your **soft skills**, and these are just as important when applying for a job.

Luckily, describing a non-technical experience can be very similar to technical experiences. In fact, the template mentioned above can be used and adapted to non-technical skills. Let's illustrate this through an example:

*You are part of a gardening club, in a membership role. As a member, you carry out some of the tasks such as caring for some of the plants at the club's nursery, participate in the bi-weekly meetings and provide assistance in some of the events held by the club.*

Using the description template we could write some bullet points from this:

> - Maintained the club's nursery by monitoring and caring for **number** different species of plants, in collaboration with **number** members.
> - Prepared **number** club activities by attending bi-weekly club meetings, communicating and discussing ideas and scheduling **number** events.
> - Increased event attendance by **number** of attendees by developing the marketing campaigns of the club with a group of **number** members.

These points describe your experience, but also highlight your interests as an individual and some of your soft-skills.*Collaboration, communication, time management, dependability, decision-making* are all great examples of soft-skills showcased in these points, and you would not even need to list them out! Do not take non-technical experience lightly, as it could help you just as, if not more than your technical experience when it comes to standing out among other applicants.

### Notes

- Differentiating current experiences from past experiences in writing:
    - Although we will go into proper resume structure in the following section, there is a small detail to keep in mind when describing your experiences. Whenever you address an ongoing experience (i.e. a current position, or project that you are currently working on), you want to make sure that your action verbs are written in present tense. This means that instead of writing *Ensured*, you would write *Ensure*; or *Develop* instead of *Developed*. Even if the task has been already been completed, if the experience is ongoing, the proper etiquette is to keep it in present tense.
    - Any other experience you will keep using past tense.

## Next Steps

Now that you know how to write and phrase your experiences, the next step is to build your resume.
